# Supported Browsers
Imagine is designed to work on the following browsers on Windows, Linux and OSX machines.
 

- Edge (v16+)
 
- Chrome (v67+)
 
- Firefox (v61+)
 
- Safari (v11.2+)
 
- Opera 



The same browsers are supported on iOS, Android and Windows 10 Mobile however some functionality may be restricted. For example, iOS does not allow you to run the apps in full screen in browser. We do not provide minimum version numbers of these for mobile devices.



Although we provide version numbers we support on desktop machines we recommend for security purposes always enabling browser updates automatically and always running the latest version.
